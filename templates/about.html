        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2026, Syncra TechX was born from a simple observation: most companies struggle to keep their technical capabilities in sync with their business ambitions. Our mission is to provide the intelligent technology and elite talent necessary to close that gap.</p>
        <p>We operate at the intersection of innovation and execution, ensuring that every line of code we write contributes directly to our clients' success.</p>
